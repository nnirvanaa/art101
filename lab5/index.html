  <h1>Lab 5: JavaScript Output</h1>

  <h2>Challenge</h2>
  <p>In this lab, we were tasked with creating a JavaScript file that uses variables to store vehicle data and then outputs the results using <code>document.writeln()</code> into the browser. The challenge helped us understand how data can be structured in code and printed to the page.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>The main issue I encountered was making sure the path to the JavaScript file was correctly written in the HTML. Once I fixed the path, the output displayed as expected. I also had to make sure the CSS and images were in the correct folders for everything to show up properly.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Here is the result of the JavaScript output:</p>

  <h3>Script Output</h3>
  <div class="output">
    Make: Toyota<br>
    Model: Camry<br>
    Color: Blue<br>
    Year: 2015<br>
    Do I own it? true<br>
    Age: 10<br>
  </div>

  <h3>Vehicle Image</h3>
  <img src="img/lab5-screenshot.jpg" alt="Toyota Camry" width="400"><br><br>

  <h3>Lab Screenshots</h3>
  <p>Below are screenshots showing my editor and browser output:</p>

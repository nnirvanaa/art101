  <h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>

  <div id="challenge">
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>This lab focuses on practicing loops in JavaScript to automate repetitive tasks. The assignment involves using a loop to cycle through numbers 1 to 200 and conditionally append special words based on divisibility rules. The FizzBuzzBoom logic is extended to include not just multiples of 3 and 5, but also 7. The challenge is to dynamically print custom messages depending on each number's divisibility.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>One of the initial issues was getting the output to appear in the right location on the page. It was also important to make sure the logic for multiple conditions—like combining "Fizz", "Buzz", and "Boom"—worked correctly without skipping any steps. Some small syntax mistakes, such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable names, caused errors before the code could run properly. Troubleshooting with the browser console helped solve those issues efficiently.</p>

  <div id="results">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Below is the result of the loop running from 1 to 200. Numbers are printed with special labels if they meet the conditions: "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "Boom" for multiples of 7. When a number meets more than one condition, those labels are combined. The final output is generated and displayed below using jQuery and a JavaScript function.</p>

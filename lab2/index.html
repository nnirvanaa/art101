					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>one challange I had was making sure I had all the correct coding, I would input a change and it would not load or show up when I opened it on the browser. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One issue I had was chaning the CSS, it would not show up on the browser however I did a bit of reserch and went on discord to see if anyone else encountered the same issues I did. I was able to eventually figure everything out after trial and error. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment was a bit difficult for me as I have no experience with coding. I did put effort into this assignment but considering that it is a couple days late and I did not find a partner in time, I know I could have done a lot better. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<p>I was able to successfully link my CSS and see changes in the browser. I also learned how to organize HTML better and troubleshoot file paths. I'm proud of figuring it out!</p>

  <h1>Lab 8 - Anonymous Functions & Callbacks</h1>

  <h2>Challenge</h2>
  <p>The challenge for this lab was to experiment with the <code>map()</code> function using both named and anonymous functions. An array of numbers was created and modified with different operations passed in as callbacks.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>There were no major issues during the process. One minor challenge was structuring the anonymous function correctly, but checking output in the console helped resolve it.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Console output displays the results of applying both the named and anonymous functions using <code>map()</code>. Open the browser's developer console to view the output.</p>
  <p>This is an image of the console for this lab:</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>This lab provided a clearer understanding of how <code>map()</code> works with different types of functions. Using callbacks simplifies array transformations and makes the code more concise compared to traditional loops.</p>

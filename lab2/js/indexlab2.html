        My name is Nirvana Alcaraz. I am currently a junior transfer student at UCSC.
        I am an art major with a HAVC minor. I did not find a partner for this assignment
        but I did not want to leave it missing. I hope I get a little credit for this.
        If I did have a partner I bet they would be very cool.

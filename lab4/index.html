			<h1>Lab 4 - pseudocoding & problem-solving </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Lab Description</h2>
					<p>In this lab, we practiced writing pseudocode and translating it into JavaScript comments. This helped us plan out a simple computer game—Rock, Paper, Scissors—before writing any actual code. It emphasized the importance of logical thinking and structuring a program step by step.</p>
				  </div>					  
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>one of the challenges I faced was trying to attach my javascript file onto my lab4 index.html file.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p><p>One problem I ran into was forgetting to link my JavaScript file properly in the HTML. At first, nothing was showing up in the browser console, and I couldnt figure out why my `console.log()` statements werent working. After checking my code, I realized I had a typo in the file path for the script tag. Once I corrected the path to point to the right location, everything started working.</p>
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p></p>This lab showed me how helpful it is to plan with pseudocode. It made coding feel more organized and less confusing.</p>

						  <p>This is the pseudocode I created for a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game:</p>
					  
						  <pre>
					  // Rock Paper Scissors Game pseudocode
					  // Author: Nirvana Alcaraz
					  // Date: April 22, 2025
					  
					  // Display game instructions
						  // Briefly explain how to play and the rules
					  // Initialize game
						  // Set initial variables (e.g., score, number of rounds)
					  // Start game loop
						  // Repeat for a set number of rounds or until player chooses to quit
					  // Get player input
						  // Prompt user to choose rock, paper, or scissors
						  // Validate input (must be one of the three choices)
					  // Generate computer choice
						  // Randomly pick rock, paper, or scissors
					  // Compare choices to determine winner
						  // Rock beats scissors
						  // Scissors beats paper
						  // Paper beats rock
						  // If same choice, it's a tie
					  // Display round result
						  // Show both choices
						  // Announce the winner or if its a tie
					  // Update score
						  // Add win/loss/tie to score tracking
					  // Ask if player wants to play again
						  // If yes, repeat from Get player input
						  // If no, proceed to end game
					  // Display final result
						  // Show total wins, losses, and ties
						  // Thank the player for playing
						  </pre>
